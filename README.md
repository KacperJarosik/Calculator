# Full funcional calculator app

## Description
The calculator has all basic functions and handles errors.
To write this application, I used Tkinter in Python. To use it, you need a Python compiler with appropriate imports. Maybe I'll add the exe file later.
## Instruction

Operation algorithm:
1) Enter the first number
2) Select the operation you are interested in
3) Enter the second number
4) press the equals sign to get the result

Function buttons:
- +/- sign change
- C reset calculator
